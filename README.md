# discord-bot
A Python Discord bot I created for fun.

This bot is currently being hosted on an AWS server to always be online for use in a private Discord server comprised of friends. 

To use this bot for yourself you will need to install all the imported libraries as well as creating/obtaining an OpenAI API Key. As well as creating an .env file for all other keys used.
